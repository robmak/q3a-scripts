# Custom gfx settings for Quake3e

There are 4 available tiers for settings:
* pro: super low graphic options to grant high visibility but low fidelity
* low: anyone still got issues running a game from 1999?
* medium: this is for you laptop users on 4k displays
* high: got a dedicated graphics card?

This python script reads all settings from gfx-variables.json definition file and
writes the resulting settings files to configs subfolder. Just take them from there.
The script just creates an easier way to manipulate all 4 files at the same time.

See custom-quake3e-settings.cfg for additional Quake3e settings you should be
aware of and which are not related to graphical features.
